Setup

Game Phases
Planning Phase- during this phase players in turn order assign one of their meeples at a time to either; intend to explore a location by placing their meeple in the 1,2,3 spot of a location card
or placing their meeple on one of their facedown redshirts to show that the team member is staying back to remove them from harms way or to perform an action.

Explore Phase- during this phase players in turn order select a location where they have a meeple and resolve all of the searches in order of meeples.
To explore players may reveal up to three pieces of evidence from their location's evidence pile. If the player ever has two bigfoot tags amongst their searched evidence cards then a random redshirt of theirs goes MIA.
If any player reveals a bigfoot symbol on an evidence card it is a total party kill and everyone on the location becomes MIA and no evidence is collected (survivors collect a eyewitness +2 static points however).
If a player goes MIA place the evidence that redshirt found faceup back on to the location (to be shuffled back in during the clean up phase) and randomly assign MIA status to a redshirt that did not stay back.
Once all locations with meeples have been resolved, perform any remaining actions of redshirts that stayed back during the planning phase.

Clean Up- during this phase make sure that all evidence piles have 11 cards in them by adding random evidence from the group pile until there is the correct amount.
In reverse turn order players draw back a number of redshirts equal to the number that went MIA this turn during the explore phase.
At the end of this phase players may lay claim if they have enough evidence to do so, if someone does there is one more full round for all other players (See Lay Claim section for more information)
